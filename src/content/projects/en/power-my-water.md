Granted, many African homes, communities and businesses have water boreholes dug. The only challenge is the electricity to power their 1.5-2.5 hp water boreholes as a result of inefficient Hydroelectricity as well as the enslaving Fuel and Diesel generators with which these boreholes are presently "inefficiently powered.

With the revolutionary invention of Solar powered water borehole Sumos (Water extracting machines), Africa and Africans are ready and willing to say bye-bye to Hydroelectric and/or Fuel/Diesel powered Water borehole Sumos/Water pumps. Join our pilot project in Igboland of West Africa.
