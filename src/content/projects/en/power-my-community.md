In the absence of the Moon, darkness covers African communities just as silence greets every household; joy disappears to the detriment of the African youths. These communities are rich enough to purchase and install Solar Energy but are simple unaware how to go about it.

EkeSolar has been holding sensitization conferences and campaigns to educate African communities on Solar Energy potentials. We will continue to enlighten members of African Communities on the efficiency of Solar (Sun) Energy against the present inefficient Hydroelectricity or Fuel/Diesel power generators.

EkeSolar Unlimited also calculates the Solar Energy need of each community as well as professionally install Solar Energy for African communities to end this Hydroelectric and fuel/diesel generator nightmares. Join EkeSolar to bring positive change in a large scale.
