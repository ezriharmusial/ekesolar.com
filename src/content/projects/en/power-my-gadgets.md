From Laptop to phones, Bluetooth to WIFI and Networking gadgets, electric energy is known to be the soul of every gadget. Notwithstanding the fact that Africans own and use various electronic gadgets, the lack of constant electricity has drastically reduced Africa's role and participation in our 21st century global village.

While it is true that many students can't afford "standard" Solar Energy, many pray for affordable Solar Energy Solutions. EkeSolar Public Charging Units are designed to enable everyone (especially students) charge his/her gadget(s) from place to place. EkeSolar is looking for international partners to bring our EkeSolar Charging Interface (ECI UNITS) to fruition. Contact us for joint venture.
