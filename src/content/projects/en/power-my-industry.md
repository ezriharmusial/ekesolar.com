Nothing requires constant electricity than the machineries with which industries are operated. Here in Africa, epileptic electricity as a result of gross incompetency and outdated energy source has led many industries in Africa to unprecedented bankruptcy. Also, the lack of awareness of Solar Energy potentials has further deepened the frustration of the African industrialists. This also is about to change.

Through EkeSolar organised conferences, many industrialists have become aware of the redeemer called Solar Energy (Ike-Anwu). To become one of our speakers during EkeSolar conference or a supplier and/or consultant to Africa's Large, Small or Medium scale industries. Let's work together.
