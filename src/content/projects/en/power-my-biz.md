Plagued with unemployment, the majority of the Africans are self-employed through various business engagements. As you know, electric power is vital in making any given business uccessful. Many Africans suffer insufficient or total lack of electricity as we speak. Granted, this situation is a business-killer.

Many Africans are embracing Solar energy as a viable alternative to the presently used Hydroelectricity and/or fuel/Diesel power generators. Since self-sustainability of the African majority depends on their various businesses, powering them with Solar energy will surely empower them in becoming financially independent. Let EkeSolar Unlimited link you with the African business communities.
