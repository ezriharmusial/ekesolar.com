Presently, in most of the African communities, darkness covers the environs including streets and roads. Accidents and unnecessary lost of life is the result. BRIGHT NIGHT PROJECT (BNP) is the initiative of EkeSolar Unlimited through which abundant Street/Event lights are purchased and installed for communities and towns in Africa.

We need powerful and durable outdoor Solar-Energy lights to light up African streets and put an end to accidents caused by sheepishness as a result of avoidable darkness on the streets/roads here in Africa. Do you deal on outdoor Solar lamps, street lights and floodlights? Contact EkeSolar Unlimited today.
