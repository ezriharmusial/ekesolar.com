Regrettably, most of the medical complications and deaths could rightfully be attributed to the lack of Electric power in most of the Africa's hospitals. Can you imagine what happen during surgery when suddenly, electric power falls out? Catastrophe. This has been the story of most African hospitals and clinics who resorted to the enslaving/expensive alternative of using Fuel/Diesel power generators with so many disadvantages.

Via EkeSolar Unlimited, ArtKids Intl. Corp. Holland has intervened and is presently equipping hospitals with the needed Solar Energy. Join us as we bring positive #changes by equipping Africa's hospitals with the ever needed Solar (Sun) Energy.
